### HMM Markov Models
**Activity Recognition Using Hidden Markov Models on Smartphone Sensor Data**

### About the Project
To build a model that recognizes human activities using smartphone sensor data. Human physical activities are like walking, running, sitting etc. We use time-series data from smartphone sensors to train a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to classify these actions.

### Dataset
Using the UCI-HAR Dataset:
- [UCI-HAR Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones)
The dataset contains readings from various sensors of a smartphone(Samsung Galaxy S II).
- Activities: Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying

### What is HMM?
TBD....TBD
